Features added in Version 15.09a
--------------------------------
* Reorganize TC code base (ASACORE-1376)
* Security 2.0 was added as a Developer Preview Feature (ASACORE-1393)

             e.g., "en" doesn't match "en-US"
ASACORE-2214 eventaction_service TL test sample crashes if introspected with
             language not supported by translator

Compatibility
-------------
Starting in Version 15.09
* The AJ_Connect() API is DEPRECATED (since 14.02)
* The APIs for About in the core/about_tcl repo are DEPRECATED (since 14.06)
* Claimed 15.09 apps/devices (A/D using Security 2.0) cannot interact securely
  with pre-15.09 A/D using ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange; further, if the A/D only
  exposes interfaces/objects requiring security it will not be possible to
  interact with the A/D. This is because once an A/D is claimed, it expects to
  receive a manifest from the ECDHE_ECDSA peer, and pre-15.09 A/D do not support
  sending manifests (which were introduced as part Security 2.0 in the 15.09
  release).
* Language tag matching uses prefix matching and also will return the default
  language if there is no match where previously it would return an
  error. (ASACORE-2209)
* Moving the PropertiesChanged signal from the org.freedesktop.DBus interface to
  the org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties interface (ASACORE-2185) stops
  applications based on AllJoyn 15.04 and older from receiving this signal from
  those based on 15.09 and newer, and vice versa. The impact should not be
  significant since the PropertiesChanged functionality prior to the 15.09
  release did not work.  Note that the change in the alljoyn.git project was
  done in 14.12, so this makes TC applications compatible with SC applications.
Source Compatibility
* Crypto APIs have been changed to enhance target portability
  * Removed internal AJ_Crypto_PRF() and HMAC APIs that were unused or could be
    statically scoped
  * Updated ECC and SHA256 APIs and data types to hide implementation
  * Moved optional low-level AES and DRBG crypto APIs to new header files
